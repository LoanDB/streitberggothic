# Source directory

This directory contains the "raw" source data of the dataset from which the
CLDF dataset in [`cldf/`](../cldf) is derived.

- `Streitberg-1910-3659.xml` is the original file, downloaded from http://www.wulfila.be/lib/streitberg/1910/
- `xml2tsv.py` is the Python script with which I converted the xml to tsv by running it from the terminal
- `Streitberg-1910-3659.tsv` is the raw file that cldfbench will use as input
